# Scalable Email Sending Service


## Getting started
These are two lambda functions that allow you to send emails while avoiding the risk of failure in sending by introducing the notion of Queue with AWS SQS.

First of all, we have a microservice that gets user data and send that as a message in the AWS Queue and another message-sending triggered microservice that receives and processes message.


## Tools
